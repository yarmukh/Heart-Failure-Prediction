A machine learning project for predicting heart disease using linear models.

## ðŸ“‹ About the project

This project uses machine learning methods to classify patients based on the presence or absence of heart disease. The project is based on linear models such as logistic regression.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

### Preliminary requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-detection.git
cd heart-disease-detection
```
